<h2 id="who-was-albert-einstein-">Who Was Albert Einstein?</h2>
<p>Albert Einstein (1879â€“1955) was a theoretical physicist renowned for developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His famous equation, (E = mc^2), revealed the relationship between mass and energy, forming a cornerstone of contemporary physics. </p>
<p>Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein&#39;s intellectual curiosity emerged early, leading him to question the fundamental laws of nature. He worked in a Swiss patent office while developing groundbreaking ideas that would redefine our understanding of the universe. His contributions earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a critical piece in the development of quantum theory.</p>
<p>Einstein&#39;s legacy extends beyond science. He was a pacifist, human rights advocate, and outspoken critic of militarism. In his later years, he emigrated to the United States, escaping the rise of Nazism in Germany. He spent the remainder of his life at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, contributing to the global scientific community.</p>
